# Chocolate-Bar-Ratings
# Project Summary
This descriptive analysis explores expert ratings of chocolate bars to uncover key insights about quality, origin, and composition. Specifically, the analysis will examine the relationship between cocoa percentage and ratings, and identify which regions produce the best chocolate bars and where the highest-quality cocoa beans are grown.

The dataset includes expert reviews for over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with details such as:

  - Country of production
  - Bean origin
  - Cocoa solids percentage
  - Bean variety

Key Questions

  1. Where are the best cocoa beans grown?
  2. Which countries produce the highest-rated chocolate bars?
  3. What is the relationship between cocoa solids percentage and rating?

# Data Contents
  ○ company, company_location, country_of_bean_origin, specific_bean_origin_or_bar_name, review_date, taste descriptors (e.g., first_taste, second_taste)
  ○ Continuous: rating (score from 1 to 5), cocoa_percent (percentage of cocoa content)
  ○ Other: Ingredients presence (e.g., vanilla, lecithin), review notes, broad taste notes
● Geographical Components: company_location and country_of_bean_origin allow for spatial analysis across countries and regions.
● Rows: Over 1,700 entries (chocolate bar reviews)
● Variables:
  ○ Categorical: Limitations
● Subjectivity: Ratings reflect personal tastes, leading to potential bias and variability.
● Sampling Bias: Overrepresentation of popular brands or regions common among
reviewers.
● Static Data: Historical data (2006–2017) with no updates, limiting current relevance.
● Manual Errors: Possible data entry inconsistencies or missing values.
